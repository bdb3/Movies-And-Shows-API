2 options...

1 - use external API to relay data
PROS - quicker to implement, search function already built,  more data 
CONS - less control over data, could take longer to load data from another source


2 - download data, add to db, expose via API
PROS - elasticsearch likely quicker than pinging another API
CONS - takes a while to download, transform, and load data into db

We will go with option 1 because both will satisfy requirements as listed in 
backend prompt, but option 1 will take significantly less time.
